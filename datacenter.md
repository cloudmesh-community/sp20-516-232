## E.Datacenter.1: Define carbon footprint of data centers

Carbon footprint of a data center is *Carbon dioxide emission coefficient of a Data Center*

## E.Datacenter.2.b: Clonee Data Center

### Overview

Facebook broke ground on the Clonee data centre in 2016 and the first building became operational in December 2017. The centre is built on a 250-acre site. Brookfield Renewable supplying 100% renewable wind energy to this Data Center [@CloneeDC-sp20-516-232].

## E.Datacenter.4: Recyclers

Recycling is linked with renewable energy as it helps in replenishing the natural resources of the earth. One of the biggest sources of renewable energy is *heat*. The concept of heat reuse is has been proven in high energy use facilities such as laboratories. Typical laboratory systems take energy from the exhaust air to precondition outside air. A similar concept exists for energy recovery ventilators in office buildings.  

A growing number of data centers are redirecting the heat from their hot aisles to nearby homes, offices, greenhouses and even swimming pools. The ability to re-use excess heat from servers is being built into new data centers, helping to improve the energy efficiency profile of these facilities.  

### How Server Heat Recycling Works

Temperatures in most data center hot aisles range from 80 to 115 degrees Fahrenheit. Data centers can use  heat pumps to boost the temperature of the waste heat, making it more valuable for use in district heating, often by transferring the heat to liquids that are easier to transport and incorporate into heating systems [@HeatRecycle-sp20-516-232]. 

Some interesting examples of heat recycling are:

**Telecity (France)**:

Telecity is using waste heat from its Condorcet data center in Paris to heat an on-site Climate Change Arboretum

**IBM (Switzerland)**:
An IBM data center in Switzerland is being used to heat a nearby swimming pool. 

**IBM and Syracuse University (New York)**:
A data center built by IBM and Syracuse University uses gas-powered micro-turbines to generate on-site power. During the winter, the 585 degree F (307 C) exhaust from the micro-turbines flows through heat exchangers to produce hot water, which is then piped to a nearby office building to be reused in the building’s heating system.

**Notre Dame University (Indiana)**:
The Notre Dame Center for Research Computing has placed a rack of high-performance computing (HPC) nodes at a local municipal greenhouse, the South Bend Greenhouse and Botanical Garden, to help heat the flowers and plants in the facility.

**Facebook Cloud campus in Odense, Denmark**: 
Facebook expects the Odense system will warm 6,900 homes by data center servers in Stockholm and other European cities that employ district heating.

Data centers may soon recycle heat into electricity too. Rice University researchers are developing a system that converts waste heat into light and then that light back into electricity.

## E.Datacenter.5: Iceland: Efforts towards renewable energy:

Iceland is a leader in renewable energy. Iceland is the only country in the world which obtains 100% of its electricity and heat from renewable sources. 87% of its electricity comes from hydro-power, and the remaining 13% from geothermalpower. Icelanders are pioneers in the use of geothermal energy for space heating, with 90% of Icelandic households heated with geothermal water. Clean and affordable hot water is brought directly from boreholes to houses via pipelines. The remaining buildings are heated with electricity from renewable sources. Iceland's unique geology allows it to produce renewable energy relatively cheaply, from a variety of sources. There are over 200 volcanoes located in Iceland and over 600 hot springs. There are over 20 high-temperature steam fields that are at least 300 °F. All these sources allowing Iceland to harness geothermal energy.

## E.Datacenter.6: Data Center Cooling Technologies

Cooling systems have evolved over the years. Traditionally, there are two ways of cooling a data center  
* air-based cooling
* liquid-based cooling  

Data center smart assistant is a new and innovative way of cooling a data center. It is reported that the amount of money spent on cooling is more than required. A smart assistant like AdeptDC helps data centers save on costs as it identifies and lets the data center manager know when and how much cooling is needed. It uses smart cooling and machine learning to read CPU and GPU temperatures and processes that data in real time. This software will help data centers become more cooling efficient.

## E.Datacenter.7: Nature 

Demand for Internet and mobile-phone traffic skyrocketting, the information industry is going to cause an explosion in energy use. The total electricity demand of information and communications technology (ICT) is likely to increase about 15-fold by 2030 and may require 40,000TWh of energy. Scientists in academic labs and engineers at some of the world’s wealthiest companies are already exploring ways to keep the industry’s environmental impact in check. They are streamlining computing processes, switching to renewables and investigating better ways to cool data centres and to recycle their waste heat. By 2020 efficient Hyperscal data centers are predicted to replace smaller, less efficient data centers.  Systems like Autoscale invented to reduce the number of servers that need to be on during low-traffic hours. This led to power savings of about 10–15%.  

Computers in a data center work 24/7 at tremendously high rates that they get exceptionally hot. Sophisticated cooling systems need to be applied for these computers to continue working without overheating.  Exploring innovative cooling solutions and making existing ones cheaper will become more important in coming years.

## E.Datacenter.8: British Airways (BA) Data Center outage

An IT outage on May 27 that caused British Airways (BA) to cancel more than 400 flights and strand 75,000 passengers in one day. The airline was forced to ground hundreds of flights when its CBRE-managed Heathrow data center lost power. Later cause of the error was identified as human error. An engineer had disconnected a power supply at the data center near London’s Heathrow airport, and when it was reconnected, it caused a surge of power that resulted in major data center damage. This was no small accident. It’s estimated to have cost BA as much as 100 million euros.
